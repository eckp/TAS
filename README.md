# Test, Analysis &amp; Simulation


### Structure of the repository

**cooling** directory contains the results obtained from the cooling rate analysis such as the exponential fitting to the experimental data.

**data** directory contains the experimental data provided stored in excel and matlab files.

**temperature_history.py** is the script used to perform the temperature history analysis of the experimental data.

**data.py** contains general data about the experiments such as laser power and compaction force.

**experiment.py** constains the Experiment class used to store all data about each experiment.

**experiment_read.py** contains the basic infrastructure used to exctract the data from the excel and matlab files.

**nip_point_back.py** is used to analyse the nip point temperature of the rear camera.

**nip_point_front.py** is used to analyse the nip point temperature of the front camera.
